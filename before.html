  <strong><u>Corona Pandemic</u></strong> inspired individuals to look for new ways<br>
  to sustain their lives. Now that many things have stopped, individuals continue to<br>
  worry and research about the world that has changed from their position.<br>
  With this in mind,the coronavirus before it arrived was expressed in the form of a <br>
  high-energy meteorite just before it collided. It stops the target with the force <br>
  of a collision but at the same time starts a new movement.</p>
